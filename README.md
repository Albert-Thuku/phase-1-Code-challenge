## Project Description
There are three sections of this code challenge.
PART(1): A Grading System
->The user inputs a mark ranging from 0 to 100. The mark is run through a series of condition that generate a corresponding grade that is output to the user.

->THe user inputs the speed. If the speed is within the speed limit range of 70km/hr then the system outputs "Ok". However, when the speed inputed is above the speed limit then the system calculates the number of demerit points a driver earns. In the case that a driver has more than 12 points, there license is suspended.
